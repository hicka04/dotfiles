# Planning

* Review the codebase and outline your approach.
  * If anything is unclear, ask for clarification.
* When performing the same work across multiple files, split the work into separate tasks for each file.
* Do **not** start writing code at this stage.

# Coding

* Commit your changes for each individual task.
